## Project Status

Ask-Gloom is under active development. While core features are stable, we're continuously adding improvements and new capabilities.

## Architecture

Ask-Gloom is built on three main components:

1. **Conversation Manager**
   - Handles dialogue flow
   - Manages context
   - Coordinates memory operations

2. **Language Processing**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Response generation
   - Entity extraction

3. **Memory Interface**
   - Integration with Gloom memory systems
   - Knowledge graph management
   - Context preservation

## Use Cases

- Conversational AI systems
- Virtual assistants
- Knowledge-based chat systems
- Research in cognitive dialogue systems
- Educational interactions
